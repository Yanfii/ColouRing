    <string name="tutorial_text_2">The objective of ColouRing is to form the best possible colour gradient from the inner circle to the outer ring.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_text_3">In order to select a colour, tap on one of the four sections of each ring. The other sections of that ring will be grayed out.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_text_4">Continue to work your way out of the circle. Keep in mind that the selected path must be connected between rings.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_text_5">When you reach the outer ring, you will receive a message at the bottom of the screen if the gradient you selected is correct.  </string>
